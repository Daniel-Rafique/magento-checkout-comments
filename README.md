magento-checkout-comments
=========================

Here is a module that inserts a textfield in the checkout review step so customers can add delivery instructions. The comments are visible in the customers account and inside the Admin Sales/Order/View page.

If this module has helped you and you are happ with it feel free to buy me a coffe using my Onename - Enjoy!
